The code defines a simple List component using React. It consists of two sub-components: 
WrappedSingleListItem and WrappedListComponent.
WrappedSingleListItem is responsible for rendering each individual list item, 
while WrappedListComponent renders the entire list by mapping over an array of items and rendering 
WrappedSingleListItem for each of them.

The WrappedSingleListItem component receives four props:

1)- index: a number representing the index of the item in the list
2)- isSelected: a boolean indicating whether the item is selected or not
3)- onClickHandler: a function that handles the click event on the item
4)- text: a string representing the text content of the item

It renders an <li> element with a background color of green if isSelected is true and red if isSelected is false.
It also attaches an onClick event handler that calls onClickHandler with the index of the item.

The WrappedListComponent receives one prop:

1)- items: an array of objects, each with a "text" property representing the text content of the list item

It uses the useState hook to maintain the selected index state and useEffect hook to reset the selected
index whenever the items prop changes. It also defines a handleClick function that sets the selected index 
when a list item is clicked.
It renders a <ul> element with a textAlign style of left, and maps over the items array to render a SingleListItem
component for each item. It passes in the necessary props to the SingleListItem component:
onClickHandler, text, index, and isSelected.
